<!--
    --- RPS 101 RPG ---
    Player has 3 lives at the start of the game.
    As much as possible, one set of rounds only. However, if we can, make it 3. (Ako nalang bahala if ever -Djinn)
    At the start of the set, the player will get three random options from the API. (e.g. Paper, Woman, and Nuke)
    Player will choose one of three options to combat against the enemy. (Keybinds are A, S, and D)
    Depending on the result, the loser will lose one life.
    The game continues until all lives are emptied.
